Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test. Please be patient and help out, and
remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code.

Unit tests for the core code are in `src/test/`. To compile and run them:

    cd src; make -f makefile.unix test

Unit tests for the GUI code are in `src/qt/test/`. To compile and run them:

    qmake HOMACOIN_QT_TEST=1 -o Makefile.test homacoin-qt.pro
    make -f Makefile.test
    ./homacoin-qt_test
